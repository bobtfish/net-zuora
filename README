NAME
    Net::Zuora - SOAP::Lite wrapper around the Zuora Z-Billing API

SYNOPSIS
        use Net::Zuora;
        my $z = Net::Zuora->new(
            usename => 'MyAPIUserName',
            password => 'MyAPIPassword',
        );

DESCRIPTION
    Perl wrapper around SOAP::Lite to interface with the Zuora Z-Billing API
    (<http://www.zuora.com>)

NOTE
    THIS CODE IS INCOMPLETE - it does not currently support all the features
    of the Zuora API, and is not currently being developed.

    It is here as a guide/starting point for someone looking to implement a
    wrapper to Zuora's API in perl.

METHODS
BUGS
    Plenty, along with missing features. This module was implemented whilst
    we were evaluating the Zuora solution, however it is in no way feature
    complete, but I thought I should share it to give the next person coming
    to this problem a useful base to start from.

    Code is available on github from:
    <http://github.com/bobtfish/net-zuora>.

    Patches (and taking over this project entirely) welcome.
